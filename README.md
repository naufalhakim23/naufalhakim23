## Hi 👋, I'm Naufal Al-Hakim</h1>
Disbursement Whisperer | Backend Chaos Coordinator | 🐹 Gopher Enthusiast | 🧠 AI Fanboy

### Experience
- Former Lead of transactional recalibration and asynchronous disbursement orchestration within high-throughput aquatic economic infrastructures (eFishery, but with more syllables).  
- Pioneered the vertically scalable redundancy matrix for sub-second reconciliation pattern detection, handling annual financial throughput larger than small island nations.  
- Executive Associate of latency annihilation and director of distributed inconsistency optimization in service of goal-oriented system idempotency and casual backend sorcery.  
- Go microservice overlord. Once rewrote a 45s query to 0.8s out of boredom.
- Most of my magic happens in eFishery’s codebase (Bitbucket + Gitea gang 😭), so GitHub’s green squares lie (except when I write weird stuff). I swear I write code daily.


### Currently Learning
- Structural liquidity synthesis (as it applies to payment disbursement and plant hydration)  
- Telemetry-driven existential dread  
- Reverse-chaotic eventual consistency  
- gRPC-based emotional support systems  
- Rat-based economic modeling  
- Situational data sculpting with SQL and guilt  
- If I write enough PromQL to summon Cthulhu, I’ll use NixOS

## 🧰 Things I Actually Know

- **Languages**: Go (🐐), Python, JavaScript
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, MySQL (because sometimes reality needs indexing)
- **Pubsubs**: Kafka, RabbitMQ (for sending help)
- **Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes (containers inside containers like emotional baggage)
- **Observ**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger (observability or bust)  
- **Frameworks**: Microservices, REST APIs, Pub/Subs, and tears
- **ML**: AI playgrounds on Colab for when I feel like vibing with 1.5B parameters


## 🧪 Side Projects That Actually Exist (and worked)

- 🧬 [Deepseek Playground on Colab](https://github.com/naufalhakim23/deepseek-r1-playground):  
   Just me giving Google Colab the ability to run LLMs like a pro.  
   Plug and play with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B like it's 2049.

- 💧**Soil Moisture AI System**:  
  ML-powered water control for cherry tomatoes. Because feeding tomatoes is more satisfying than feeding logs to ELK.
  It worked for months, but I unplugged it because the tomato is really tall.

## 📜 Certifications (to prove I’m not making this up, I have more but dunno where did I put it)

- [Tensorflow Developer](https://coursera.org/verify/specialization/NY56VUFBD9ZL) by DeepLearning.AI  
- [Google IT Automation with Python](https://coursera.org/verify/specialization/VV7NU4QSM2ZW)

## ⚡ Quick Hits

- 🛠 Refactored legacy code → System runs 2x faster
- 🧩 Built payment infra → Handles 7-figure transactions monthly
- 🔥 Reduced reconciliation time by 90%
- 🧠 BSc in Physics → Still confused by Schrödinger’s cat

### Beliefs

- All systems are distributed systems if you close your eyes  
- If it works in prod, it’s not a bug—it’s folklore  
- Every payment API integration is a cryptid  
- Uptime is a state of mind
